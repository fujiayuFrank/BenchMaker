Your overall task is to help create a benchmark with multiple-choice questions about "{{ability}}". Specifically:

#### ***Task*** {{task content}}
#### ***Question Content*** {{task content analysis}}
#### ***Options*** {{option analysis}}

Now, I need you to think about how to control the difficulty of the questions you design. Specifically, given the following difficulty levels:

Level 1: The simplest, equivalent to lower-grade elementary school
Level 2: Relatively simple, equivalent to upper-grade elementary school
Level 3: Simple, equivalent to middle school
Level 4: Average, equivalent to high school
Level 5: Slightly difficult, equivalent to university student
Level 6: Difficult, equivalent to Master's
Level 7: Quite difficult, equivalent to PhD student
Level 8: Very difficult, equivalent to professor
Level 9: Extremely difficult, equivalent to field expert
Level 10: Most difficult, equivalent to top human level or beyond human level

For each level, please consider the characteristics that the questions should have and the process by which they should be constructed to meet the corresponding difficulty requirements based on the given task description.

Your output format should be (use !!! to split different levels):
!!!
### Level 1: The simplest, equivalent to lower-grade elementary school level
### {{Thought process: What characteristics the questions should have and how they should be constructed based on the given task description to meet this difficulty level.}}
### {{Summary of your thoughts: Specifically describe what characteristics the questions should have and how they should be constructed based on the given task description to meet this difficulty level.}}
!!!
### Level 2: Relatively simple, equivalent to upper-grade elementary school level
### {{Thought process: What characteristics the questions should have and how they should be constructed based on the given task description to meet this difficulty level.}}
### {{Summary of your thoughts: Specifically describe what characteristics the questions should have and how they should be constructed based on the given task description to meet this difficulty level.}}
