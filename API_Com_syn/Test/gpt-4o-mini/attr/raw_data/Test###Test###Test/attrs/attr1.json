{"task": "Assess the model's creativity and versatility in generating a range of outputs based on varied prompts.", "query": "A diverse set of prompts that require the model to generate different types of content, such as a short story, a recipe, a product description, or a poem. Each prompt should have clear parameters and expectations.", "option": "Includes multiple generated outputs based on the prompts, presenting one high-quality, coherent, and relevant response as the correct choice. The other options should be less relevant, poorly constructed, or off-topic responses that showcase a lack of understanding or creativity. They should be plausible enough so that individuals without strong content generation skills might select them as correct."}
