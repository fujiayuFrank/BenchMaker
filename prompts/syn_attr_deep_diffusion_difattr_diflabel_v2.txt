You are a knowledgeable benchmark creator.
Your task is to generate a creative question based on the provided Task Description, Query Description, Option Description, General Attributes Descriptions, Difficulty Attributes Description, Generation Guidelines, and Output Description to help build a benchmark that assesses the given task.

### Overall Task Description:
{{original task}}


### Detailed Task Description:
{{task define}}


### Query Description:
{{query define}}


### Option Description:
{{option define}}


### General Attributes Description:
You can refer to the following attributes and their corresponding values to construct questions, which means the questions you generate should ideally align with some of these attributes.
Please note, if you find any conflicting or confusing parts among the attributes listed, you may disregard them.
{{attribute define}}


### Difficulty Attributes Description:
Your generated questions should meet the following difficulty attribute requirements. If you find conflicts among these requirements, you may choose to selectively ignore them.
{{difficulty attribute define}}


### Difficulty Description:
The following are some samples (0 or several).
Please ensure that the difficulty level of the samples you generate is {{difficulty direction}} than these examples.
The samples you generate should aim to assess different knowledge and skills compared to the given samples.
The format of given samples are not what you should follow.
**Please ensure that the sample you create differ substantially from the following samples, so as to maintain diversity in the resulting benchmark.**
{{demonstrations}}


### Generation Guidelines:
**Stage 1: Analyze**
In this stage, you should analyze following the steps below and begin with "##Analyses:##". **You need to clearly articulate the analysis content for each step**, which means after completing Stage 1, you should have already produced a question that meets the requirements along with a correct and unique answer.
1-1. Analyze the general attributes, difficulty attributes and difficulty description, and think step-by-step about the content needed to construct the question. **Please use your imagination and avoid any obvious overlap with the given samples, either in the specific knowledge points being tested or in the format.**
1-2. Start by drafting your question. If you discover any issues with the question or any overlapping parts between the generated question and the given samples during this process, feel free to revise it.
1-3. Think through what the correct answer should be. If you discover any issues during this process, repeat the entire Stage 1 process from the beginning.
1-4. Identify the plausible and potentially misleading incorrect options that could serve as distractors (at least nine). If you discover any issues during this process, repeat the entire Stage 1 process from the beginning.
1-5. Reevaluate your proposed question, answer and options to ensure that: the question meet the given attributes and Difficulty Description (you should compare the generated samples and given samples to verify this); the answer is both correct and unique. If it does not meet these criteria or you are not sure about this, repeat the entire Stage 1 process from the beginning.

**Stage 2: Generate Sample**
In this stage, you should give your generated sample in the right template based on the analyses above.
2-1. Generate the question content, begin with "##Question:##".
2-2. Generate a step-by-step reasoning process and the corresponding correct answer. Begin with "##Reasoning Path:##". If you find an issue with the question, return to Step 2-1 to regenerate the question.
2-3. Generate {{OptionNum}} candidates, with only one as the right option. Begin with "##Candidates:##".
2-4. Generate the index of the right option, begin with "##Right Option:##".
2-5. Generate the attributes you used in the generated sample, begin with "##Attributes Used:##".

### Output Description:
Strictly follow the template below to generate your sample.
**Template**
##Analyses:## {{You analyze the provided attributes and outline the process for constructing the question to be generated.}}
##Question:## {{Your generated question content}}
##Reasoning Path:## {{Your step-by-step reasoning process}}
##Candidates:##
{{CandidatesDemo}}

##Right Option:##{{Index of the right option, e.g., B}}
##Attributes Used:##{{the attributes you used in the generated sample, split use "##" e.g., attribute1:value##attribute2:value##attribute3:value}}
**Template End**


Attention: You need to **strictly follow the template** and don't generate any other contents. Begin your response with "##Analyses:##\n1-1. "
