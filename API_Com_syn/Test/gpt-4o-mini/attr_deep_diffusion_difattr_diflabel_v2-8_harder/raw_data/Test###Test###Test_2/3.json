{"analyses": "1-1. To construct the question, I need to incorporate the requirements for generating a combination that is long (11+ characters), has more numbers than letters, and specifically includes a certain structure. The character set will include alphanumeric characters and symbols. Keeping in mind the complexity suggested by the difficulty attributes, I will aim for a moderate challenge that distinguishes correct combinations from distractors effectively.\n\n1-2. The proposed question will ask the model to generate a 15-character string consisting of 6 letters (with at least 3 being uppercase), 9 numbers, and 2 special symbols. This structure is unique compared to given examples, ensuring no overlap while still challenging the model\u2019s creativity.\n\n1-3. The correct answer must adhere strictly to the specified character counts and requirements. Therefore, I might create a sample combination like \"ABC12#345XYZ678!\" which fits all criteria.\n\n1-4. I will generate plausible distractors, such as:\n- A combination that has too few letters,\n- A combination that puts the wrong count of numbers,\n- A combination that has the right count but incorrect casing for letters,\n- A combination that is too long or too short.\n\nExamples of plausible distractors include:\n1. \"ABC12345678!!\" - misses required number of letters.\n2. \"ABC123#4XZ56789!\" - has too many total characters.\n3. \"abc123456789!!!\" - does not have uppercase letters.\n4. \"ABC12#345XYZ678!\" - is the correct one.\n5. \"ABCDE12345!!\" - not enough numbers.\n6. \"ABC12#34!5678\" - incorrect character count and arrangement. \n7. \"ABCDE#FGH12!12345\" - too long and additional letters.\n8. \"1234567890!!ABC\" - misplaced order with more numbers than letters but fails character variety. \n\n1-5.
