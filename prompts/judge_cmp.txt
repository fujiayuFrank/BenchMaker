###Your task: Correctness Analysis
1. Analyze whether the question is correct, reasonable, and clearly stated.
2. For the given question, analyze whether the provided ###Candidate 1 and ###Candidate 2 are correct step by step sequentially.
(Do not favor a candidate just because it is long; evaluate candidates strictly based on correctness.)
3. Based on the above analysis, output your judgment of the question quality according to the following scale:
    0 point indicate an incorrect question with ambiguities and no uniquely suitable answer among the options.
    1 point indicates a minor error in the question, but there is still a uniquely suitable answer among the options.
    2 point indicate no errors in the question, with one uniquely correct answer among the options.
4. Please also output your chosen correct option
You should follow the template below to output:
"###Faithfulness:{{score}}###, !!!Label:{{}}!!!" (e.g., ###Faithfulness:2###,!!!Label:B!!!).
Please note that if you believe there is no correct option or there are multiple correct options, output ###Faithfulness:0###, !!!Label:None!!!.

You should begin your response with "Correctness Analysis".
