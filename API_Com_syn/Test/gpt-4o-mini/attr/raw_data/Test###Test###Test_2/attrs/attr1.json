{"task": "Assess the model's ability to generate novel combinations of numbers, strings, and symbols.", "query": "The question should present a specific context or requirement that prompts the generation of a combination. For example, the question might ask the model to create a unique code using alphanumeric characters and special symbols that meets certain criteria, such as length or structure, e.g., \"Generate a 6-character string that consists of 3 letters, 2 numbers, and 1 special symbol.\" This will require the model to apply creativity and understanding of the requirements to generate a fitting output.", "option": "The answer choices should consist of several different generated combinations that adhere to or deviate from the criteria provided in the question. One option should be correct, meeting all specified conditions, while the others should be incorrect, either by not following the character requirements (e.g., too short, overly long, incorrect type of characters) or containing unintended repetitions or errors, making it plausible to confuse for the correct option. This creates a challenging environment for the model's assessment."}
