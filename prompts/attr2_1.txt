Your task is to help create a benchmark with multiple-choice questions about "{{ability}}". Specifically:

#### ***Task*** {{task content}}
#### ***Question Content*** {{task content analysis}}
#### ***Options*** {{option analysis}}

Below is a set of attributes and their corresponding values.

{{attributes}}

step 1. Please evaluate them sequentially on two dimensions:

Dimension 1: Assess whether the attribute is closely related to the given task and whether it serves as an appropriate attribute for controlling the diversity of generated sample.
Dimension 2: Evaluate whether the values corresponding to the attribute are comprehensive. If not, suggest any additional revisions that should be included.

step 2. Based on this evaluation, please consolidate the high-quality attributes and their values. The consolidation process should include the following steps:
    1. For attributes with high redundancy, merge them (particularly focusing on merging their values).
    2. Provide the optimized attributes and their corresponding values.

step 3. Finally, please output all the attributes that you consider relevant and meaningful for evaluating the given task along with their values. The output should include no fewer than 8 attributes, and the more, the better.

Please present the final output of step 3 in the following format (Use '###The Final Attributes###' to separate this part from the previous analyses and end with ###End of Final Attributes###):

###The Final Attributes###
Name of Attribute 1: Value 1##Value 2##Value 3...
(e.g., Reasoning Steps: 1-2##3-4##5-6##>6)
Name of Attribute 2: Value 1##Value 2##Value 3...
... ...
Name of Attribute N: Value 1##Value 2##Value 3...
###End of Final Attributes###
