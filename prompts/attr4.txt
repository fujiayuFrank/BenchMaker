Your overall task is to help create a benchmark with multiple-choice questions about "{{ability}}". Specifically:

#### ***Task*** {{task content}}
#### ***Question Content*** {{task content analysis}}
#### ***Options*** {{option analysis}}

Now, I need you to think about how to control the difficulty of the questions you design.
Specifically, your task is to identify all key attributes [A, B, ...] that significantly impact the difficulty of a given task and their corresponding potential values [A: a1, a2..., B: b1, b2,..., ...] (e.g., Required reasoning steps: 1, 2-3, 4-6, more than 6).
These combinations, such as a1+b2+c4+..., will be used to guide a large model in generating tasks with the desired difficulty characteristics, ensuring effective difficulty control in the generated tasks.

You should strictly follow the Output Format to conduct the three steps below:
**Step 1:** Based on the given task and the description of the required tasks, identify the key attributes (No less than 6, as more as possible) that influence the difficulty of the task. Then, provide the potential values corresponding to these difficulty-related attributes in order from simple to difficult.
**Step 2:** Analyze and provide a horizontal comparison to determine the difficulty coefficient corresponding to each potential value of each key attribute. The definition of the difficulty coefficient is: if a task meets the potential value, its difficulty will be multiplied by this coefficient. The difficulty coefficient should be in the range [1, 10].
**Step 3:** Output the results from Steps 1 and 2:

###Output Format###
Step 1: {Analyses, attributes and corresponding values}
Step 2: {Comparison among attribute values and then give their difficulty coefficient}
Step 3:
###The Difficulty Attributes###
{Name of Attribute 1} #### {Name of Value 1}: {Difficulty Coefficient} ## {Name of Value 2}: {Difficulty Coefficient} ## ...
...
{Name of Attribute N} #### {Name of Value 1}: {Difficulty Coefficient} ## {Name of Value 2}: {Difficulty Coefficient} ## ...
###End of Difficulty Attributes###
