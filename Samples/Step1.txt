Similarly, attributes related to "Sequence Length" may be streamlined to avoid confusion.\n\n### Step 2: Consolidation\n\n1. **Merge Redundant Attributes:**\n   - Combine "Required Elements" and "Required Components" as they represent similar aspects of the task.\n   - Similarly, merge attributes related to "Complexity Level" and "Difficulty" to encapsulate all ranges of complexity under one attribute.\n   - Consolidate "Special Character Set" options to avoid fragmentation.\n\n2. **Revisions:**\n   - Ensure the attributes represent a range of difficulty levels, length requirements, and composition criteria without excessive overlap.\n\n### Step 3: Final Output of Attributes\n\n###The Final Attributes###\nLength Requirement: 6 characters##8 characters##10 characters##12 characters##16 characters##20 characters  \nComposition Requirements: At least one number##At least one uppercase letter##At least one lowercase letter##At least one special character##A combination of all the above  \nComplexity Level: Low complexity (simple combinations)##Medium complexity (mixed patterns)##High complexity (randomized sequences)  \nSpecial Characters Allowed: Common symbols (e.g., !@#$%)##Extended symbols (e.g., ()_+-=[]{};\')##No special characters  \nContext of Use: Random identifier generation##Password creation##Unique serial number assignment##Security token design  \nOutput Format: Alphanumeric only##Mixed alphanumeric with symbols##Length-restricted sentences  \nDistinct Character Types: At least 2 different character types (number and letter)##At least 3 unique characters  \nError Type for Distractors: Missing required elements (one or more component missing)##Overextended sequences (too many characters)##Invalid character usage (unsupported symbols)  \nPattern Variability: Allowed repeated characters##No allowed repeated characters  \n###End of Final Attributes###']
