{"task": "Assess the model's ability to generate a combination of numbers and strings effectively.", "query": "A series of prompts that ask the model to create a specific combination of numbers and strings, specifying the desired length and format of the output (e.g., \"Generate a string that starts with 'A', followed by two digits, and ends with a character '@'\"). The questions should include variations in the complexity of the combinations, such as including different types of strings (alphabetical, alphanumeric, special characters) and patterns.", "option": "The answer should consist of multiple options, including one correct answer that meets the given criteria and several distractors that slightly deviate from the required format. The incorrect options may vary in string length, order of elements, or character types (e.g., \"A12@\", \"A1234@\", \"12A@\"). There should be enough similarity in structure to make them plausible, encouraging model discernment."}
