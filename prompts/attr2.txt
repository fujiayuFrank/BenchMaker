Your task is to help create a benchmark with multiple-choice questions about "{{ability}}". Specifically:

#### ***Task*** {{task content}}
#### ***Question Content*** {{task content analysis}}
#### ***Options*** {{option analysis}}

Please help me think through the attributes (No less than 6, as more as possible) that should be included if we want a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability in this task. Additionally, please provide all the potential values (in detail) for each attribute.

Please note that I will randomly select one value from each attribute to use as input when generating questions for the model. Therefore, please ensure that your attribute divisions and the corresponding values follow a logical structure, leading to appropriate question content.

Refer to the following format and examples to analyze and then give your response:

## Output Format
#### ***Task*** Task content ***End of Task***
#### ***Attribute Analysis*** Task content analysis ***End of Attribute Analysis***
(Note: separate each value within each attribute by ##)
(Note: 'Difficulty' must be included as a main attribute)

## Example 1
#### ***Task*** Evaluate the model's mathematical abilities ***End of Task***
#### ***Attribute Analysis***
*** Question Category: Set theory##Algebra##Number theory##Geometry##Calculus##Combinatorics##Probability and statistics##Discrete mathematics##Applied mathematics##Category theory
*** Difficulty: Elementary level##Middle school level##High school level##Undergraduate level##Graduate level##Professor level
*** Question Presentation Style: Natural language##Symbolic form##Code form
*** Question Length: Less than 50 words##50-100 words##More than 100 words
*** Question Authorâ€™s Cultural Background: Asia##Africa##Europe##South America##North America
*** Problem Type: Word problem##Graph-based problem##Equation solving##Proof-based problem##Data interpretation
*** Error Type for Distractors: Miscalculation##Misunderstanding of concepts##Over-simplification##Incorrect assumption##Logical fallacy
***End of Attribute Analysis***

## Example 2
#### ***Task*** Evaluate the model's ability to judge whether two words are synonyms ***End of Task***
#### ***Attribute Analysis***
*** Word Domain: Everyday life##Education and academia##Science and engineering##Medicine and health##Business and economics##Law##Arts and culture##Finance and investment##News and media##Politics##Architecture and design##Agriculture and food##Sports and fitness##Military and defense##Environment and ecology
*** Part of Speech: Noun##Verb##Adjective##Adverb##Preposition
*** Word Pair Type: Synonyms with very similar forms##Synonyms with less similar forms##Non-synonyms with very similar forms##Non-synonyms with less similar forms
*** Difficulty: Easy to judge##Moderately difficult to judge##Very difficult to judge
*** Polysemy: Low##Moderate##High
*** Degree of Synonymy: Exact##Near##Partial
*** Concreteness vs. Abstractness: Concrete##Abstract##Mixed
***End of Attribute Analysis***

Based on the examples above, provide a complete and thoughtful analysis for constructing specific attribute analyses related to assessing the "{{ability}}" skill. Please strictly follow the format and structure above for your output!
