{"task": "Assess the model's proficiency in algebraic operations using Chinese.", "query": "A mathematical problem stated in Chinese that involves algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, presented with clear variables and a specific objective (e.g., solving for x). The language should be straightforward but require a solid understanding of algebraic concepts. For instance, \"\u5982\u679c x + 5 = 10, x \u7b49\u4e8e\u591a\u5c11?\" (If x + 5 = 10, what is x?).", "option": "Four options are provided: one correct answer and three distractors that are plausible yet incorrect. The distractors should include common mistakes, such as miscalculations or incorrect algebraic manipulation, to challenge the test taker. For example, if the correct answer is 5, the choices might include: A) 5, B) 3, C) 10, D) 0. This setup encourages the model to demonstrate its understanding of algebraic operations while working with Chinese language comprehension."}
