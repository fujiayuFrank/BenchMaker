{"task": "Evaluate the model's ability to generate a combination of numbers and strings.", "query": "A query that specifies the type of combination required, such as a specific pattern (e.g., \"Generate a string that starts with a letter followed by two digits\"), along with any constraints or styles (e.g., \"Include at least one uppercase letter and no repeated digits\").", "option": "Multiple options that include correct combinations matching the specified criteria alongside plausible but incorrect variations that may have similar elements but fail one or more specified requirements (e.g., combinations that repeat digits or do not adhere to the required format). Choices should also challenge the model's understanding of diverse potential combinations."}
