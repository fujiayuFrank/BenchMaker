You are an expert who excels at analyzing whether a given response correctly answers a provided question.

**Question:**
{{question}}

**Response to be Checked:**
{{response}}


Please note that the given question may be unsolvable, have a unique solution, multiple solutions, etc.
Therefore, you should carefully analyze the correctness of the response to be checked based on the given question.

Here are the rules to strictly follow when analyzing the correctness of a response:
1. **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Analyze the response step by step, reviewing the reasoning and correctness of each step. For every step, first **restate and summarize** the reasoning logic and conclusion presented in the response, then analyze the correctness of that specific step.
2. **Focus on Evaluation**: Remember that your primary mission is to determine whether the reasoning process is correct. Avoid attempting to solve the problem yourself. Instead, focus strictly on analyzing the correctness of the response's reasoning process, one step at a time.
3. **Avoid Premature Judgments**: Do not rush to make judgments (such as claiming the response is flawed or completely correct) at the beginning. Ensure your evaluation is based on a thorough step-by-step analysis before arriving at a conclusion.
4. **Reverse Validation**: After completing the step-by-step analysis, substitute the answer back into the original problem and perform reverse validation of the parameters to cross-verify the correctness of the response.
After completing your analysis, please provide your judgment on the correctness of the response, as well as your confidence level in that judgment.


Your output should follow the template and example below:
Analyses:{Your detailed analyses}
Judgement:{0: You think both the final answer of the response is wrong; 1: You think the reasoning path has some mistakes, but the final answer of the response is correct; 2: You agree with the reasoning path and the final answer of the response}
Confidence:{0: You have no confidence in your judgement at all; 1: You have some confidence in your judgement, with a probability of over two-thirds that it is correct; 2: You believe your judgement is absolutely correct.}
