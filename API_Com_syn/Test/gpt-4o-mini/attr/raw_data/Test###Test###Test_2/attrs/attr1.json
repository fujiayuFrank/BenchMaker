{"task": "Assess the model's ability to generate diverse combinations of numbers, strings, and symbols.", "query": "A query requiring the model to produce a sequence that includes a mix of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters, while adhering to specified length and complexity requirements. The question should clearly state the required elements and the context (e.g., \"Generate a 10-character unique identifier that includes at least one number, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character\").", "option": "A selection of multiple generated sequences where one option is a valid answer (correctly matching the requirements) and the remaining choices are plausible but do not fully meet all specified criteria (e.g., sequences missing one required component, those that are too short or too long, or those that include only letters without any numbers or symbols). The incorrect options should be designed to appear plausible to test the model's ability to discern the correct combination effectively."}
